     Args:
         output_size: the target output size of the image of the form H x W.
-                     Can be a tuple (H, W) or a single H for a square image H x H.
+                     Can be a tuple (H, W) or a single H for a square image H x H
                      H and W can be either a ``int``, or ``None`` which means the size will
                      be the same as that of the input.
